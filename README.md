# First Entry: Think Like A Programmer

When going back to the Rock Paper Scissors game, I neglected to use the 
technique learned recently. Understand, plan, pseudocode, and divide. It 
would have saved some time, but I was already familiar with the project
and code, so it didn't cause trouble. Etch a Sketch is a new project, 
so I want to do it well and take it seriously. The project foundations 
have been prepared; the files are empty but linked together. Now is time
to think like a programmer!
